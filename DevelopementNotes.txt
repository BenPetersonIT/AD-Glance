Developement notes:

- Check the use of Test-Connection. Make sure it makes sense and is needed.
- Create better building blocks. Create functions that act on one computer or user then use that to create functions that repeat that task across multiple targets.
- Create functions that gather accounts from OUs then use those to power scripts that act on groups of accounts.
- Break down Get-ComputerInformation into separate functions and then recombine.
